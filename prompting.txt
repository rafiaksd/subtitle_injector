You are an expert in Arabic

I will give you Arabic subtitle data that is timestamped at the word level, where each subtitle block contains only a single Arabic word with its own start and end time.

Your task is to group these words into coherent sentence-level subtitles.
You must rely on semantic flow to determine likely sentence boundaries.

Requirements:
- Each output subtitle should contain a complete, meaningful Arabic sentence or clause.
- Sentences should be natural and complete.
- The subtitle's start time should match the first word's start time in the sentence.
- The subtitle's end time should match the first word's starting time in the next sentence.
- Do not remove any words or sentences
- Absolutely MUST keep each subtitle between 6-10 seconds
- MUST KEEP the subtitles between 6-10 seconds
-- if any sentence do not fit within 6-10 seconds split it, and use ... to show continuation

Example:

Input:
كان 00:01:13,920   00:01:14,140
أحمد 00:01:14,140   00:01:14,260
يمشي 00:01:14,260   00:01:14,820
بسرعة 00:01:14,820   00:01:14,940
إلى 00:01:14,940   00:01:15,340
المدرسة 00:01:15,340   00:01:15,680

Output:
كان أحمد يمشي بسرعة إلى المدرسة 00:01:15,680 00:01:13,920

Example END

Input:


Output:

=========
=========

After completing the Arabic sentence grouping, translate every single subtitle into English.
In the English translation:
- Replace the word “God” with “Allah”.
- Replace any instance of “peace be upon him” (referring to the Prophet) with “ﷺ”.
- Replace May Allah be Pleased with him with رضي الله عنه

The final result MUST be formatted in standard .srt subtitle format and only have the TRANSLATED ENGLISH PART.

JUST PROVIDE THE TRANSLATED ENGLISH SUBTITLE PART, NOTHING ELSE
